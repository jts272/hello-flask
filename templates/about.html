<!-- Source: https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Thorin_and_Company -->
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
