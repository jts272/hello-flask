<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the
      Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the
      Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While
      in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799.
      He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
      At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.
